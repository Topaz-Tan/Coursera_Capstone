Blogpost: Findings from 'Exploring Singapore'

From our research, we can conclude that the best locations to set up shop would be in neighbourhoods from clusters 4 and 5, such as Orchard and River Valley. This is because these neighbourhoods are popular shopping destinations for both locals and tourists alike, thus foot traffic here will likely be the highest.

Other factors which we could explore in a subsequent analysis would include cost of rental, as well as customer segmentation and sampling to determine their taste and preferences.

Our Analysis of each neighbourhood is also limited by where we place our Geographic Centre of the neighbourhood. For example, the Southern Islands neighbourhood actually encompasses Sentosa, which being a tourist hotspot might be a good location for us, but falls outside our search radius.

Thus, further refinement of our model will be highly beneficial.
